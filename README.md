# BlackjackJava

This is a little project I developed on Java over Winter break. User will have the option to play a game against either the computer or other players. If user selects the
player option, user can then select how many players in total will be playing (minimum is 2, maximum is 7). If computer is selected then it will only be one player and
the computer. Then, the game operates like a typical Blackjack game (if you don't know the rules, look them up). Game can go on for multiple rounds, and will end when the
user follows the prompt to end the game. Whoever wins the most rounds wins. Stick this into your favorite IDE and enjoy!

Currently I am developing an interface for this program. I've made decent progress on it but with school starting back up i'm currently putting that on the backburner.
If someone wants to reach out and ask for the current state of the UI, i'll gladly provide the source code I have so far. If anyone wants to help that could also help me
get this done faster.
